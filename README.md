Candle is EmmyLua typings for Project Zomboid's Java API. 

## Advantages
- Types are exposed to IntelliSense through EmmyLua, showing what goes where and what's returned.
- No time spent decompiling the game and running tools to get typings. (They are provided already)
- Built using **[PZ-Rosetta](https://github.com/asledgehammer/PZ-Rosetta)**, using **[Project Zomboid's JavaDocs](https://projectzomboid.com/modding/)** to make the typings friendlier. (Parameter names, Documentation notes, etc.)

## Caveats
- Each EmmyLua environment behaves differently. (vscode plugin, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) This could cause issues.
- Forks of EmmyLua behave differently. This can cause issues depending on use.

## Setup

1) **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** or **[vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** installed.
2) **EmmyLua** **[IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9768-emmylua)** or **[extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tangzx.emmylua)** installed.
3) Create new project.
4) Place typings into project where the EmmyLua plugin or extension requires.
5) Have fun!
