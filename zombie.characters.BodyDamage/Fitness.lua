---  We setup a timer after finishing an exercice, 12h after, we gonna start to

---  vars while increasing pain, untill no more stiffness is to be added.  Stiffness
---  will depend on regularity, fatigue.  Numbers approx: At 0 regularity, 60min
---  should gives almost 4h of stiffness (gets additional pain)
